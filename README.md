# Lunar Lander â€“ Capstone Project

This project is part of the fourth and last [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system) of the University of Alberta's specialization on Reinforcement Learning. The aim of this course is to use the knowledge from all previous three courses to build an entire RL system. In this case, the project provided by the instructors consists of a Lunar Lander, as found in [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/).
